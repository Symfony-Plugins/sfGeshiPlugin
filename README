sfGeshiPlugin
========================

Provides easy use of Generic Syntac Highlighter (GeSHi) in symfony projects.
Current release of the plugin is based on version 1.0.8.5 of GeSHI.

Installation
============

    $ ./symfony plugin:install sfGeshiPlugin

The plugin is provided with an example module to test if everything works
fine. Go to your application _config_ directory and add _sfGeshiExample_
module to _enabled modules_ section in _settings.yml_ file. Next step is
to edit _config/routing.yml_ file of the plugin - you shall uncomment all
lines. Then clear the cache:

    $ ./symfony cc

and everything is ready to run:

    http://local.site/geshi

in your browser. You shall see a demonstration of highlighting PHP code of
the actions.class.php file.

Usage
=====

It's obvious - store all the code you want to highlight in one variable and
pass it as the first parameter to sfGeshi class constructor. The second
parameter is the language name. See the example below:

    [php]
    $code_orig = "<?php echo \"hello GeSHi\"; ?>";
    $geshi = new sfGeshi($code_orig, 'php');
    $code_high = $geshi->parse_code();

sfGeshiExample
--------------

The plugin provides a GeSHi syntax highlighting example. The code is generated
inside the action:

    [php]
    $geshi = new sfGeshi(implode("", file(__FILE__)), 'php');
    $this->code = $geshi->parse_code();

and displayed in the template:

    [php]
    <?php echo $code ?>

As you can see, there's nothing difficult.
